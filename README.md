I'm Charlie (online, at least) from Germany, use they/them and he/him pronouns and create a wide range of mostly shitty websites and python apps.

I have a personal website that I put very little effort into, [czarlie.me](https://czarlie.me), which links you to some of my recent projects and other accounts.
Please note that since Microsoft's acquisition of GitHub, I have switched to [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com) for the most part. You can find my profile [here](https://gitlab.com/Czarlie).
