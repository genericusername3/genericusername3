I'm Charlie, from Germany, use they/she pronouns and create a range of mostly shitty websites and python thingys.

I have a personal website that I put very little effort into, [cza.li](https://cza.li) (which may at any point be down because I can't be bothered to check nginx regularly), which links you to some of my recent projects and other accounts.
Please note that since Microsoft's acquisition of GitHub, I have switched to [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com) for the most part. You can find my profile [here](https://gitlab.com/Czarlie).
